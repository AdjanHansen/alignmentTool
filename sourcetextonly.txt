Crumpling a sheet of paper seems simple and doesn't require much effort, but explaining the crumpled ball\rquote s behavior is another matter entirely. Once a paper ball is scrunched, it is more than 75 percent air. Yet it displays surprising strength and resists further compression, a fact that has confounded physicists. A report in Physical Review Letters, though, describes one aspect of the behavior of crumpled sheets: changes in their size in relation to the force they withstand.\par
     A crushed thin sheet is essentially a mass of conical points connected by curved ridges, which store energy. In the event of further compression of the sheet these ridges collapse and smaller ones form, increasing the amount of stored energy within the wad. Scientists at the University of Chicago modeled the relation between compression force and ball size. The researchers crumpled a sheet of thin aluminized Mylar and then placed it inside a cylinder equipped with a piston to crush the sheet. Instead of collapsing to a final fixed size, the height of the crushed ball continued to decrease, even three weeks after the researchers had applied the weight.\par
